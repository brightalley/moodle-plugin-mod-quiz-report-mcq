MCQ Breakdown quiz report

Install into /mod/quiz/report/mcq

This is a quiz report, so once you've installed it, to try it out you'll need a quiz that contains
some multiple choice questions, and which has been attempted by some students.

(Note that it does not work with random questions, nor do I see how it could.)

Go to your quiz, and click 'Results' in the Navigation block. The 'MCQ breakdown' will appear below.
Click this to see the report.

The report should be self explanatory, but note that there is a 'print view' link at top right;
this opens the report in a format suitable for printing.
